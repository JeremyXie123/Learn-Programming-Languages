## How To Build/Compile
1. Ensure that you have all the prerequisites installed: (https://github.com/James-Yu/LaTeX-Workshop/wiki/Install)
    * Ensure that you install Tex Live or MikTex
    * On windows, latexmk must be installed manually, via tlmgr: `tlmgr install latexmk`

2. Open the tex file in VSC and click on the green button in the top right:

3. A pdf file with the same name as your file of choice will be compiled, and can be used for viewing.

## Extra Info
* There are probably other ways to work with tex and its dependencies
* I followed some topics from a [LaTeX tutorial on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCzF5gDy60g)
    * There is material I did not take down from the tutorial
* If you have trouble compilling latex documents, you can start off with the online LaTex text editor, [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com)
