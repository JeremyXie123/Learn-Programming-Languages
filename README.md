# Learn-Programming-Languages
* I will use this repository to document code while I learn new languages
* If a filetype is runnable via a well known VSC extension, I will likely have used it.
* I used windows 10 for all the languages I could run.
* In any of the folders, the `CodeInfo.md` file will contain information on how to build/run the code, as well as extra info.
